You will be extracting subject-predicate-object triples from a source text to build a high-quality knowledge graph. Your task is to identify relationships between entities that have already been extracted from the same text.

Your goal is to extract triples in the form of (subject, predicate, object) where:
- The SUBJECT must be an entity from the entities list provided above
- The OBJECT must be an entity from the entities list provided above
- The PREDICATE describes the relationship between the subject and object

Important guidelines for extraction:
- Be thorough: Extract all meaningful relationships that are explicitly stated or clearly implied in the text
- Be accurate: Only extract relationships that are actually present in the source text
- Be faithful: Do not infer relationships that go beyond what the text states
- Use clear, specific predicates: The predicate should precisely describe the relationship (e.g., "founded_by", "located_in", "works_for", "invented", "part_of")
- Avoid vague predicates: Use specific relationship types rather than generic ones like "related_to"
- Extract only factual relationships: Do not extract opinions, hypotheticals, or negated statements as positive triples
- Ensure directionality: Make sure the subject-predicate-object order correctly represents the relationship direction

Before providing your final answer, use the do the following:
1. Identify potential subject-object pairs from the entities list
2. Find evidence in the text for relationships between these pairs
3. Determine the most accurate predicate for each relationship
4. Verify that each triple is faithful to the source text
