You will be extracting entities from an article to build a high-quality knowledge graph. Your goal is to identify all important entities and categorize them consistently.

Your task is to extract entities from this article. Follow these guidelines carefully.

## Entity Types to Extract

Identify entities that fall into these categories:

- **PERSON**: Individual people (historical figures, celebrities, authors, politicians, etc.)
- **ORGANIZATION**: Companies, institutions, government bodies, bands, sports teams, non-profits, etc.
- **LOCATION**: Cities, countries, regions, landmarks, geographical features, buildings
- **DATE**: Specific dates, years, time periods, decades, centuries
- **EVENT**: Named events, wars, conferences, ceremonies, festivals, competitions
- **WORK**: Books, films, songs, albums, artworks, publications, TV shows
- **CONCEPT**: Important ideas, theories, movements, philosophies, fields of study, religions
- **PRODUCT**: Specific products, technologies, inventions, software, devices

## Extraction Guidelines

Follow these rules when extracting entities:

1. **Focus on substantive mentions**: Extract entities that are central to the article's topic or mentioned with significant detail. Avoid entities that are only mentioned in passing.

2. **Use official or common names**: Use the most widely recognized or official name for each entity as it appears in the article.

3. **Avoid overly generic terms**: Do not extract generic terms like "city", "book", or "person" unless they are specifically defined as concepts in the article (e.g., an article about "The concept of personhood").

4. **Use full names for people**: Extract complete names as they first appear in the article (e.g., "Marie Curie" rather than just "Curie").

5. **Normalize entity names**: If an entity is referred to by multiple names or variations, choose one canonical form. For example, "U.S.", "USA", and "United States" should all be normalized to "United States".

6. **Extract each unique entity only once**: Even if an entity appears multiple times in the article, list it only once in your output.

## Your Task

Before providing your final output, work through the article systematically. In your extraction process:

1. Identify the main subject or topic of the article
2. Read through the article and list all potential entity mentions as you encounter them. Quote or write down each mention. It's OK for this section to be quite long.
3. For each potential entity you listed, evaluate it against the extraction guidelines:
   - Is it substantive or just a passing mention?
   - Is it too generic?
   - Should it be included?
4. Determine the correct entity type for each entity you're including
5. Identify all entities that need normalization by listing all variations you see for the same entity (e.g., "U.S.", "USA", "United States"), then choose the canonical form
6. Note any ambiguous entities or cases where you're uncertain
