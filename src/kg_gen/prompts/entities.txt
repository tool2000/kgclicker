You will be extracting entities from an article to build a knowledge graph. Your task is to identify all important entities mentioned in the article and return them as a simple list of entity names.

## Entity Categories (for reference during analysis)

As you analyze the article, consider entities from these categories:
- **People**: Individual persons (historical figures, celebrities, authors, politicians, etc.)
- **Organizations**: Companies, institutions, government bodies, bands, sports teams, non-profits, etc.
- **Locations**: Cities, countries, regions, landmarks, geographical features, buildings
- **Dates and Time Periods**: Specific dates, years, or time periods
- **Events**: Wars, conferences, ceremonies, festivals, competitions, etc.
- **Creative Works**: Books, films, songs, albums, artworks, publications, TV shows
- **Concepts**: Ideas, theories, movements, philosophies, fields of study, religions
- **Products**: Technologies, inventions, software, devices

## Extraction Guidelines

Follow these rules when identifying entities:

1. **Focus on substantive mentions**: Extract entities that are central to the article's topic OR mentioned with meaningful detail or context. Include entities that receive even moderate attention. Only skip entities that appear in pure passing with no context at all.

2. **Use official or common names**: Use the most widely recognized or official name for each entity as it appears in the article.

3. **Avoid overly generic terms**: Do not extract generic terms like "city", "book", or "person" unless they are specifically defined as concepts being discussed.

4. **Use full names for people**: Extract complete names as they first appear (e.g., "Marie Curie" rather than just "Curie").

5. **Normalize entity names**: If an entity has multiple names or variations in the article, choose one canonical form. For example, normalize "U.S.", "USA", and "United States of America" to "United States".

6. **Extract each unique entity only once**: Even if an entity appears multiple times, list it only once in your final output.

7. **When in doubt, include rather than exclude**: If you're uncertain whether an entity meets the criteria, include it unless it's clearly too generic or entirely lacking in context.
